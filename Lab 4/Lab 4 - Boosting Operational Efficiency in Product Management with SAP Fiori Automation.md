# Lab 4 - Boosting Operational Efficiency in Product Management with SAP Fiori Automation

## Objective

To automate Contoso Electronicsâ€™ product data management and reporting
processes using Power Automate Desktop (PAD). This will assist in
handling and processing large datasets related to product inventory,
performing automated searches, and generating detailed product reports
for internal use. The automation will streamline operational efficiency,
reduce manual effort, and ensure accuracy in data reporting.

## Solution Focus Area

Contoso Electronics, a leader in consumer electronics, maintains a vast
inventory of products. The current manual product management process,
which involves searching for product information across various
databases and generating reports, has led to several challenges:

1.  **Time-Consuming Searches**: Employees manually search through
    product data, often spending hours filtering through large datasets
    to find relevant information.

2.  **Inefficient Report Generation**: Manually generating detailed
    reports from the gathered data leads to inconsistencies, delays, and
    potential errors.

To enhance internal operational efficiency, Contoso Electronics will
implement Power Automate Desktop to automate the product search and
report generation process. The automation will reduce manual effort,
increase accuracy, and improve overall productivity.

    the UI elements, select CTRL+left click together.

- First, capture the **Manage** **Products** (Ctrl+left click) option in
  the SAP Fiori page. Once the element has been added to the UI element
  picker, click on the **Manage** **Products** option from the web page
  again (this time we are clicking on it to navigate to the next page
  and then capture the other elements from there).

    the Extract data from web page open in the Power Automate flow, open
    the browser in which we have the selected list of products on the
    SAP Fiori.

14. Right click on the column name (**Image**) and select **Extract**
    **entire** **HTML** **table**.

    products of the supplier into an Excel.

# Exercise 5: Add subflow SAP_Logoff

## Task 1: Create Sub flow SAP_Logoff

1.  Click on Subflows - **+ New subflow**.

2.  In the +++Add a subflow+++ pane, enter the name of the subflow as
    +++SAP_Logoff+++ Click on **Save**.

- ![](./media/rId276.png)

3.  The created subflow gets opened in a new tab. Open the UI Element
    pane and click on **Add UI element**.

- ![](./media/rId279.png)

4.  Capture the UI elements to perform the Log off action from the
    browser. Capture the P â€“ Profile button from the top right corner of
    the browser. To capture, press **Ctrl+Left** click on the item to be
    captured. Once captured, an entry will be made in the UI Element
    picker.

- ![](./media/rId305.png)

**Exercise 6: Configure the Main flow**

1.  The main flow does not have anything in it now. We will arrange the
    subflows that we created in order in the main flow to get a complete
    execution. First in the Main flow, from the Actions pane, drag and
    drop add an action +++On block error+++ into the Main flow tab.

- ![](./media/rId308.png)

2.  Name the error block as +++MainExceptionBlock+++ . Click on +
    **New** **rule** - **Run** **subflow**.

    from the drop down and click on Save.

- ![](./media/rId320.png)

  ![](./media/rId323.png)

6.  Similarly, add the 2 more actions of Run subflow and select
    **SearchProductBySupplier** and **SAP_Logoff** in the same order.

7.  Your main flow should now look like this.

- ![](./media/rId326.png)

8.  Click on **Save**.

- ![](./media/rId329.png)

**Exercise 7: Test the Flow**

1.  From the Main block, right-click on the **On block error** and
    select Run from here.

- ![](./media/rId332.png)

2.  Observe the flow that does the following.

    1.  Opens the SAP Fiori URL in a new Edge browser.
    2.  Logs into the system, providing the username and password.
    3.  Clicks on the Manage Products page.
    4.  Search for a specific supplier and get the list of the
        supplierâ€™s products.
    5.  Exports the data to an Excel sheet.
    6.  Logs off from the system.
    7.  Closes the browser.

**Conclusion**

In this lab, participants have successfully learned how to automate SAP
Fiori tasks using Power Automate Desktop. They explored key concepts
such as installing the Power Automate Desktop environment, creating
flows, and managing variables. Additionally, they developed error
handling with subflows, automated the SAP Fiori login process, and
captured web UI elements to automate actions like searching for products
by supplier. This exercise enhances participantsâ€™ automation skills and
introduces them to streamlining SAP Fiori processes efficiently through
Power Automate Desktop flows.
